Analysis of Malicious URLs and Machine Learning Model Building for Prediction

The structure of the URLs has been analysed to compare their characteristics and components.  Classification algorithms have then been employed to predict what class an URL falls into (benign, phishing, malware or defacement).

The accompanying report describes the findings, outcome of the model performance and recommendations of further work to potentially improve the model performance.
